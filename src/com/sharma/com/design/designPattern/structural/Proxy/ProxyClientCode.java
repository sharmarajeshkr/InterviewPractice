/*  The proxy design pattern : Is used when we want to provide controlled access of a functionality.
Example : we have a class that can run some command on the system.
         Now if we are using it, its fine but if we want to give this program to a client application,
         it can have severe issues because client program can issue command to delete some system files or
         change some settings that you donâ€™t want.
    Basically : Allow only authenticate user (Admin,Non-Admin)to execute critical commands.
